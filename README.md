### Running

* run `npm install`
* run `docker-compose up`

You can now see the producer tab making new messages and the consumer tab reading those messages. You can start more producers (while still running 1 consumer) and see more messages coming in.

### Topic Errors

If you are getting an error about the topic not existing, try running `docker-compose rm` to delete the containers. Then re-run `docker-compose up` again.
